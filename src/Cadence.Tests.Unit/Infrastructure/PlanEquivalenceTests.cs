/// Guards that projects saved in older formats still send and export the same MIDI 1.0 bytes once read

/// <remarks>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>format2-full: <see cref="ProjectSamples.Full"/>, every event type and routing option. Its mute and
/// solo flags were cleared by hand after writing, so that it plays at all.</item>
/// <item>format2-edges: a note outlasting the last event, events on bar lines, an orphan release and a
/// meta at the last tick, a track starting after a mid-bar meter change, a muted track, an empty track.</item>
/// <item>format2-canon-gm16: canon-gm16.mid imported and saved without routes, so its per-track hashes
/// equal the sample's hashes in MidiOneOutputGoldenTests.</item>
/// </list>
/// Plans are compiled through the routing model the old routes migrate to (each route's channel on its
/// connection, its transposition as a Transpose device), once with a slot per track and once with every
/// track on one slot, which pins the order between tracks that share an output. Voice selections depend on
/// resolved profiles, not on the track model, so they are left out.
