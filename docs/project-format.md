# Cadence project format

A Cadence project (`.cadence`) is a single UTF-8 JSON document. It is meant to be readable, to diff
cleanly in version control, and to stay portable: it contains no machine-local paths and no port
indices, only stable identifiers and identity hints.

## Rules

- Channels and program numbers are one-based (1–16, 1–128), as musicians see them.
- A track holds clips (ADR 0020), in any order on disk but never overlapping. A clip's `start` and
  `length` are timeline ticks. Its events' `tick`s are relative to the clip's content, and the clip
  shows content ticks from `offset` to `offset + length`. Content outside that window is kept but not
  played, so trimming a clip loses nothing. `name` is optional; without it the clip shows the
  track's name.
- A track's `role` is `instrument`, `audio`, `hybrid`, `effect`, or `group` (ADR 0021); `group`
  (optional) is the ID of the group track it belongs to. Roles are stored, and on reading a role that
  cannot show the track's content is widened (an instrument track with audio clips becomes hybrid).
- A clip's `type` is `note`, holding the events below, or `audio`, holding a `source` (`location`,
  `sampleRate`, `frames`, `channels`). Audio clips are arrangement data only; nothing plays them yet.
- Event IDs are unique across all clips of a track.
- `automation` (optional; omitted when empty) holds a track's automation lanes, in display order. A
  lane's `target` is a `controller` (with a `controller` number, not bank select, 32–63, data entry or
  increment/decrement, RPN/NRPN selectors, or channel mode), `pitchBend`, or `channelPressure`, on a
  `channel`; or a `device` parameter, by device ID and parameter ID, which is delivered to that device
  and never sent as MIDI (ADR 0024). No two lanes on a track share a target. Its `points` have timeline
  `tick`s, at most one per tick, 32-bit `value`s (normalized for device parameters), and a `curve`
  (`hold` or `linear`) for the way to the next point. A lane whose device is missing is kept.
- Channel events describe what is played, not MIDI 1.0 bytes:
  - `note`: a note with its length, attack velocity, and release velocity.
  - `noteOff`: a release with no matching note, kept from an import.
  - `controller`: a controller number (0–127) and its value.
  - `program`: a program, with optional `bankMsb` and `bankLsb` (0–127).
  - `pitchBend`, `channelPressure`, and `polyPressure` (which also has a `note`): a value.
- Controller, pitch bend, and pressure `value`s are 32-bit (0–4294967295), the MIDI 2.0 resolution.
  A MIDI 1.0 value is scaled up so that it scales back down exactly: 0 is 0, the centre (64, or
  8192 for pitch bend) is 2147483648, and 127 (or 16383) is 4294967295.
- The other event types are `sysex` (a complete `F0 … F7` message), `raw` (bytes kept verbatim from
  an import), and `meta` (a preserved meta event).
- `instruments` are external MIDI instruments (ADR 0023): a name, an optional device profile, an
  optional operating mode, and ports, each with an optional endpoint. They are stored whether or not
  their profile or endpoints are currently available.
- `chains` are device chains (ADR 0022). Each has one `owner`: a `track` (at most one chain per track)
  or a free-standing `rack`. Devices are in processing order, each with a stable `id`, a `definition`
  reference (ID plus the name and version last seen, so a missing plugin can still be named),
  normalized parameter `value`s, `bypassed`, and an opaque plugin `state` (base64, with its `format`).
- `connections` are the one routing model: `events` or `audio`, from a `source` (`track`, `rack`, or a
  `device` tap) to a `destination` (`track`, `rack`, `instrument` with a `port`, `mixer` channel, or
  `master`), with an optional channel `mapping` (`only`, then `force` or `remap`) and `voice`.
  Connections that do not validate are kept and reported, never dropped on load.
- `mixer` holds the master gain and mixer channels, which are independent of tracks.
- `extensions` and any other unrecognised top-level properties are preserved on save.
- Reading is strict: any invalid value fails with the JSON path of the problem.

## Versions and migrations

`formatVersion` increases whenever the structure changes. Older files are upgraded in memory by a
chain of migrations before they are read; saving always writes the current version. A file from a
newer Cadence is refused with an explanation and never overwritten.

Format 4 replaced the per-track `routing` with `instruments`, `chains`, `connections`, and `mixer`,
and added track `role`, `group`, audio clips, and device automation targets (ADR 0027). Each format 3
route becomes one external instrument per distinct endpoint and profile (named after the endpoint, or
"Unassigned" for a route with settings but no endpoint), a connection from the track forcing the
route's channel and selecting its voice, and, for a non-zero transposition, a Transpose device in the
track's chain. A route for a track that no longer exists is kept as a connection, which validation
reports. Every track gets the `instrument` role and the mixer starts empty. Migrated projects send
byte-identical MIDI (`Format3EquivalenceTests`).

Format 3 put each track's events in clips. A format 2 track's events move into one note clip, with
the track's ID, from the bar of its first event to the bar line after its latest end, so it plays
exactly as before; a track with no events gets no clip.

Format 2 replaced format 1's `channel` events (raw MIDI 1.0 bytes) with the channel event types
above. Format 1 files are not migrated; import the original MIDI file again instead.

## Saving and recovery

1. The whole file is written to a hidden temporary file beside the project, flushed to disk, and
   read back to verify it.
2. The previous project file is copied to `<name>.cadence.bak`.
3. The temporary file is renamed over the project (an atomic replace on the same volume).

If the project file is damaged or missing, Cadence opens the backup and says so. Autosaves go to
`<name>.cadence.recovery`; when that file is newer than the project, Cadence offers to restore it.
