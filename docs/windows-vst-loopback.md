# Windows: playing into a VST synth through a MIDI loopback

Cadence sends MIDI; it does not host plugins. To hear a software synth on Windows, run the synth in a
standalone VST host and connect Cadence to it with a MIDI loopback port. This page records the setup
that was verified and how.

## Verified setup (2026-10-04)

| Part | Used |
| ---- | ---- |
| Machine | Windows 11 ARM64 (build 26200) in Parallels Desktop on Apple Silicon |
| Loopback | Windows MIDI Services, MIDI 1.0 loopback endpoint (`Loopback1`) |
| Host | SAVIHost 32-bit (x86), running under ARM64 emulation |
| Synth | Yamaha S-YXG50 VSTi (`syxg50.dll`; it only loads in the 32-bit host) |
| Cadence output | WinMM (ADR 0014), with SysEx (ADR 0015) |

Result: the Ambient sample played through S-YXG50 correctly, including its XG SysEx setup, so short
messages and SysEx both pass through the loopback to a 32-bit host under emulation.

## Why not loopMIDI

loopMIDI (and rtpMIDI, LoopBe1 and similar) install a kernel driver. Their installer failed on ARM64
Windows with MSI error `0x80070643` on the `teVirtualMIDI64` package, because x64 kernel drivers cannot
load on ARM64. Windows MIDI Services needs no third-party driver, so it works on ARM64. On x64
Windows, loopMIDI remains a working alternative.

## Steps

1. Windows 11 already includes the Windows MIDI Services service (`midisrv`), but not the tools to
   configure it. Install **Windows MIDI Services Tools** and the **transports** from
   [github.com/microsoft/MIDI/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/MIDI/releases), choosing the
   installer for your architecture (`arm64` or `x64`). The winget package pointed at a removed
   release when this was written, so download it directly.
2. In **MIDI Settings**, create a **MIDI 1.0 loopback** endpoint. Its name does not matter.
3. Start the VST host (SAVIHost for S-YXG50) and pick the loopback as its MIDI input under
   **Devices → MIDI**. Pick an audio output under **Devices → Wave**.
4. Start Cadence **after** the loopback exists (Cadence does not detect new ports while running yet)
   and route the tracks to the loopback output.
5. Play. If the song has no XG reset, sending XG System On (`F0 43 10 4C 00 00 7E 00 F7`) first puts
   the synth in a known state.

## Notes

- The playhead may lead what you hear in the VM because of audio buffering in the host and Parallels.
  On macOS the same project lines up closely; see the timing notes in ADR 0013.
- Cadence's integration tests never target loopback or hardware ports; this check was done by hand.
